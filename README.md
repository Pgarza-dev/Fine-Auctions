[Netlify Link](https://snazzy-dieffenbachia-abb81e.netlify.app)

## Description

This project is a university assignment for Noroff, aimed at creating a new JavaScript front-end client for an existing Auction plateform. The client application is built using vanilla JavaScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and utilizes Flowbite web components for modular design. The application is designed to be attractive and responsive, with a focus on user-friendly and error-free interaction.
